# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Install via package manager
Install Bootstrap’s source Sass and JavaScript files via npm, RubyGems, Composer, or Meteor. Package managed installs don’t include documentation or our full build scripts. You can also use any demo from our Examples repo to quickly jumpstart Bootstrap projects.

npm install bootstrap@5.3.3
Include via CDN
When you only need to include Bootstrap’s compiled CSS or JS, you can use jsDelivr. See it in action with our simple quick start, or browse the examples to jumpstart your next project. You can also choose to include Popper and our JS separately.
